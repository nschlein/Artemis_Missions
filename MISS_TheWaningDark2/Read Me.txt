This mission script presents a simple exploration mission, with a small amount of voice acting to help 
build immersion. Your crew has been assigned to transport a scientist, Doctor Barnard, to various 
nebulae around the sector, so he can run experiments. Various malfunctions will keep your crew busy, 
and enemy forces may be waiting to attack. 

The Communications officer is very important for this mission. Comms should make sure to log in before 
the game is started, and be ready for an incoming transmission from the Admiral. Once a message comes in, 
the Communications officer will be able to play the message for the crew. Comms should be very careful not 
to log out or lose connection to the game until it ends. If Comms does lose connection, all of the messages 
previously received will be lost.

This script can be set to any difficulty, but a lower difficulty, around 3-7, is intended. A higher difficulty 
would make the game more serious and less comedic in nature. 

YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO NAME YOUR SHIP ANYTHING OTHER THAN ARTEMIS.
 

Good luck and have fun!

Hints:
The Communications Officer can hail friendly ships -- if they refuse to answer, that may mean trouble.
The Communications Officer can wait to delete the audio messages, and play them again if the crew wants to review orders.
The Communications Officer can also read the text of the audio messages on his Comms display.
