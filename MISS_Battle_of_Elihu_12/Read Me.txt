"The Battle of Elihu 12"

(a Canonical Battle © for Artemis 2.2x)

by Mike Substelny

This mission script lets an Artemis crew experience a canonical battle, facing the actual conditions of a critical battle
from the Artemis universe.

This was the decisive naval battle in the First Spiral Arm War. A small TSN force with Torgoth support elements defended a key
sector against an assault by ten Arvonian carrier groups. The Arvonians were equipped with their most advanced carriers and fighters,
and they were escorted by the finest Skaraan elites that money could buy. 

This script will override to difficulty setting 7 to refelect the technology level of your ship.

The author recommends a full crew of six experienced players playing the TSN Dreadnought.

DO NOT RENAME YOUR sHIP TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN ARTEMIS.
 

Good luck and have fun!

Hints:
The Communications Officer should hail your Torgoth allies to find out the condition of their ships. These allies are important
and you should lend any reasonable assistance that they may request.
The Communications Officer should micro-manage the Torgoths. The mission "Go defend Artemis" is very effective.
The mission "Attack nearest enemy" means the Torgoths will wander off after defeating one Arvonian.
